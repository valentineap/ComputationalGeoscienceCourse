    "# Assessed Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise contains four tasks. You should attempt all of them, ensuring that you have completed every part of each task. You should write your solutions into this Jupyter notebook; you may add additional cells as necessary. Your code should run correctly when each cell of the notebook is executed in the order that they appear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your attempt must be submitted via Wattle by 17:00, Friday 5th June. To submit, you should:\n",
    "- Click `File > Save and Checkpoint`\n",
    "- Click `File > Download as > Notebook (.ipynb)\n",
    "- Save the file to your computer\n",
    "- Upload this file via Wattle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to **document your code** using docstrings and comments. Where tasks require you to produce figures or other output, **marks will be awarded for the quality of presentation**: remember to include axis labels, titles, colorbars, etc. A full marking rubric is given below. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may make use of (i.e., import) the following modules:\n",
    "   - `numpy`\n",
    "   - `matplotlib`\n",
    "   - `pandas`\n",
    "   - `cartopy`\n",
    "   - `datetime`\n",
    "   - `math`\n",
    "   - `re`\n",
    "   \n",
    "**No other modules may be used** unless you have obtained permission from the course convenor (Dr Andrew Valentine). Note that you may not need to use all of the modules in the above list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drop-in sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually we organise four two-hour drop-in sessions before the submission deadline. These are times when a course tutor is available to answer any questions you may have about Python, any of the exercises, or about what is required for this assessment (obviously, we cannot help you complete the tasks!). However, in view of the 'remote teaching' this semester I propose to replace this with Zoom meetings by appointment. If you have any questions at any point, please email me (andrew.valentine@anu.edu.au) to arrange a mutually convenient time. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Oral examinations\n",
    "\n",
    "When completing this assessed exercise, you are encouraged to make use of online resources and talk to your colleagues to help you find effective solutions, and fix problems. However, everything you submit must be your own work, and you must be able to explain how your code works. To ensure this, everyone must attend a short oral examination. During this, we will ask you to explain aspects of your solution, and discuss why you chose to solve the task in that way. No particular preparation is required, although you might wish to read through your submitted work before attending the examination.\n",
    "\n",
    "These will be held via Zoom, regardless of whether the ANU campus has reopened at this point. I will send individual meeting invitations via email, nearer the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your allocated time is not convenient, you may swap with someone else, **provided that both people email me (andrew.valentine@anu.edu.au) to confirm the change**. If you are unable to find someone to swap with, or are entirely unavailable on 10th June, please contact me immediately to arrange an alternative time. **Failure to attend an oral examination will result in you receiving no credit for this assessment.**\n",

Code is concise, clear and readily understood, displaying a level of sophistication and a full understanding of the Python language. Solutions may extend beyond the stated problem, or use aspects of Python not directly taught during the course.\n",

The full range of Python constructs are employed. Errors (e.g. bad user inputs) are handled appropriately.\n",
    "-\tCode is fully-documented through docstrings and explanatory comments.\n",
    "-\tOutput conveys all required information without error or omission. Figures are suitable for inclusion in a journal publication, being generally well-presented and visually-appealing.\n",
    "-\tThe student displays a comprehensive understanding of their submission, and is able to discuss and justify the decisions and choices they made during implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Credit**\n",
    "-\tSubmitted code fully addresses the stated problem, providing correct output(s) in all cases. No significant errors or omissions are present. Code is well-structured and clear, making use of a range of Python constructs as appropriate. Some attempt is made to check for and handle errors (e.g. bad user inputs) as appropriate.\n",
    "-\tSome attempt is made to document the code through docstrings and explanatory comments, but this is incomplete or lacking in detail.\n",
    "-\tOutput conveys all required information without error or omission. Figures are suitable for inclusion in a journal publication but may lack polish and visual appeal.\n",
    "-\tStudent displays a comprehensive understanding of their submitted code, and can explain how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pass**\n",
    "-\tSubmitted code largely addresses the stated problem. Some errors or omissions may be present, and outputs may not be correct in all cases. Code may be unsophisticated, with significant redundancy or inefficiency, and may use only a limited subset of the Python language. There may be little or no effort to handle common sources of error (e.g. incorrect user inputs).\n",
    "-\tLittle or no attempt is made to document the code through docstrings and explanatory comments.\n",
    "-\tOutput conveys the required information, perhaps with minor errors or omissions. Figure quality is well below the standard expected in a good journal.\n",
    "-\tStudent displays basic familiarity with their submitted solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fail**\n",
    "-\tSubmitted code does not provide a solution to the stated problem.\n",
    "-\tOutput entirely fails to convey the required information.\n",
    "-\tStudent is unable to explain how their code works, leading the examiners to believe that the submission does not represent the students own, independent efforts.\n",

To decode a message, we look up characters in the 'cipher' row, and replace them with the corresponding character from the 'plaintext' row. Any characters not in the alphabet (e.g. punctuation characters and spaces) should be unchanged by the encoding/decoding operation.\n",

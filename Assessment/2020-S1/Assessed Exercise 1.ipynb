Code is concise, clear and readily understood, displaying a level of sophistication and a full understanding of the Python language. Solutions may extend beyond the stated problem, or use aspects of Python not directly taught during the course.\n",

The full range of Python constructs are employed. Errors (e.g. bad user inputs) are handled appropriately.\n",

    "**Credit**\n",
    "-\tSubmitted code fully addresses the stated problem, providing correct output(s) in all cases. No significant errors or omissions are present. Code is well-structured and clear, making use of a range of Python constructs as appropriate. Some attempt is made to check for and handle errors (e.g. bad user inputs) as appropriate.\n",

    "-\tSubmitted code largely addresses the stated problem. Some errors or omissions may be present, and outputs may not be correct in all cases. Code may be unsophisticated, with significant redundancy or inefficiency, and may use only a limited subset of the Python language. There may be little or no effort to handle common sources of error (e.g. incorrect user inputs).\n",

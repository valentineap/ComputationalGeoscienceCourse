    "# Assessed Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise contains four tasks. You should attempt all of them, ensuring that you have completed every part of each task. You should write your solutions into this Jupyter notebook; you may add additional cells as necessary. Your code should run correctly when each cell of the notebook is executed in the order that they appear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your attempt must be submitted via Wattle by 17:00, Friday 25th October. To submit, you should:\n",
    "- Click `File > Save and Checkpoint`\n",
    "- Click `File > Download as > Notebook (.ipynb)\n",
    "- Save the file to your computer\n",
    "- Upload this file via Wattle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to document your code using docstrings and comments. Where tasks require you to produce figures or other output, marks will be awarded for the quality of presentation: remember to include axis labels, titles, colorbars, etc. A full marking rubric is given below. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may make use of (i.e., import) the following modules:\n",
    "   - `numpy`\n",
    "   - `matplotlib`\n",
    "   - `pandas`\n",
    "   - `cartopy`\n",
    "   - `datetime`\n",
    "   - `math`\n",
    "   - `re`\n",

    "**No other modules may be used** unless you have obtained permission from the course convenor (Dr Andrew Valentine). Note that you may not need to use all of the modules in the above list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drop-in sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be four drop-in sessions before the submission deadline. These are times when a course tutor will be available to answer any questions you may have about Python, any of the exercises, or about what is required for this Assessment (obviously, we cannot help you complete the tasks!). These will take place:\n",

    "Thurs 24 Oct| 12:30-14:30\n",
    "\n",
    "All will be in the TerraView Room (Jaeger 2, top floor). Attendance at these sessions is optional, and you need not come unless you have specific questions you wish to ask. However, this is an opportunity to get help, advice and feedback if you are finding anything difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Oral examinations\n",
    "\n",
    "When completing this assessed exercise, you are encouraged to make use of online resources and talk to your colleagues to help you find effective solutions, and fix problems. However, everything you submit must be your own work, and you must be able to explain how your code works. To ensure this, everyone must attend a short oral examination. During this, we will ask you to explain aspects of your solution, and discuss why you chose to solve the task in that way. No particular preparation is required, although you might wish to read through your submitted work before attending the examination.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your allocated time is not convenient, you may swap with someone else, **provided that both people email Andrew Valentine (andrew.valentine@anu.edu.au) to confirm the change**. If you are unable to find someone to swap with, or are entirely unavailable on 31st October, please contact Andrew Valentine immediately to arrange an alternative time. **Failure to attend an oral examination will result in you receiving no credit for this assessment.**\n",

    "The R/V Investigator is Australia's main ship for ocean-based research. You have been provided with a file [`in2019_v07_uwy_data.csv`](in2019_v07_uwy_data.csv) which contains minute-by-minute records from a recent research cruise, which sailed from Hobart in Tasmania, along the south-east coast of Victoria, and back to Hobart. You will notice that any 'missing' observations are represented by the value `-999.9`.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - The deepest and shallowest points encountered on the voyage (column name 'Depth (m)')\n",
    "   - The hottest and coldest water encountered on the voyage (column name 'Water Temperature (degC)')\n",
    "2. To calculate the distance between two points expressed as (latitude,longitude), we can use the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula), $$ d = 2R\\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\phi_2-\\phi_1}{2}\\right)+ \\cos\\phi_1 \\cos\\phi_2\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_2-\\lambda_1}{2}\\right)}\\right)$$\n",

The result, $d$, is the distance in km. Write a function implementing the haversine formula, and then use this to calculate the total distance covered by the ship during its cruise. *Hint: Remember, mathematical functions are available by importing NumPy. Also, the functions `np.sin` and `np.cos` expect angles in radians, not degrees - use `np.deg2rad` to convert degrees to radians.*"

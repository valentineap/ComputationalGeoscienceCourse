    "This course provides an introduction to Python programming for geoscientists. It was developed and delivered at the [Research School of Earth Sciences](https://earthsciences.anu.edu.au), [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au) between 2018 and 2020 by Oscar Branson, Charles Le Losq, Rebecaa McGirr and Andrew Valentine.\n",

    "## Format\n",
    "The course was designed to be taught intensively, with ~45 timetabled hours over 3 weeks. Apart from an [introductory presentation](Slides/slides.pdf), which introduces some basic concepts of computer science, the course is mainly built around self-paced practical exercises. Students completed these in class time, with support from teaching staff, and with regular whole-class discussion/presentation of concepts and particular exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, students were able to move forward at a rate of about one practical per 2-3 hour session. Unsurprisingly, there is wide variation across students and across practicals. Students were advised that only material from practicals 1-16 was examinable; practicals 17-20 introduce some more advanced topics. Exercise 11 can be skipped if students are pressed for time.\n",

    "## Assessment\n",
    "Students had to complete two assignments:\n",
    "- An 'in-class test' (3 hours), taken at about the midpoint of the timetabled course, assuming knowledge of material up to Practical 7\n",
    "- A 'take-home assignment' (~3 weeks allowed) issued at the end of the timetabled course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the take-home assignment had been submitted and marked, all students attended a brief individual oral examination (~15 mins) where they were asked to discuss aspects of their solution to the exercise. This was intended to discourage collusion, and also provided an opportunity to deliver personalised feedback.\n",

    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "### On your own computer\n",
    "You can download this repository as a Zip file by [clicking here](https://github.com/valentineap/ComputationalGeoscienceCourse/zipball/master). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to work through this course on your own computer, you first need to install Python and Jupyter. There are many different ways to do this; one good option for novices is to install the free [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Once this is installed, running the `Anaconda Navigator` app should present buttons for launching a number of different tools, one of which is `Jupyter Notebook`. Clicking this should (eventually) open a Jupyter window within your web browser, and you will see a listing of the files on your computer. Navigate to your downloaded copy of this repository, and open `index.ipynb`. You can then click links that take you to each exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the cloud\n",
    "You can [click here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/valentineap/ComputationalGeoscienceCourse/binder?labpath=index.ipynb) to run the Jupyter notebooks via BinderHub. This allows you to try them out without installing anything. However, you cannot save you work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if you have [Google Drive](drive.google.com) account, you can upload a copy of the [zip file](https://github.com/valentineap/ComputationalGeoscienceCourse/zipball/master) there, unpack it, and then execute the notebooks using Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bugs and feedback\n",
    "If you find anything that does not seem to be working correctly, or you have other feedback, please feel free to open an issue in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/valentineap/ComputationalGeoscienceCourse/issues). You can also [email me](mailto:andrew.valentine@durham.ac.uk). "

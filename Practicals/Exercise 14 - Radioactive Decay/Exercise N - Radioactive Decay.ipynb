    "Unstable atomic nuclei may undergo radioactive decay, losing energy (and particles) via radiation. This is a random process, but one which can be quantified by the concept of 'half-life' or 'decay rate'. The half-life is the amount of time required for 50% of the atoms in an initially pure sample to decay. It is often represented by the symbol $t_{1/2}$, and is related to the decay rate, $\\lambda$, by the formula\n",

    "$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\lambda} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can interpret $\\lambda$ as being the probability that each nucleus will decay per unit time. We can also show that radioactive decay obeys the differential equation\n",

    "$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -N\\lambda $$\n",

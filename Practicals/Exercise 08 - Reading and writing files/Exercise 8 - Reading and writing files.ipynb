    "# Exercise 8 - Reading and writing files\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have typed all the data for our programs in 'by hand'. However, as you have no doubt noticed, this quickly gets tedious. It is useful to be able to read and write data files, allowing information to be stored and shared with other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to read a data file, we need to understand what information it contains, and how this has been encoded. This is generally referred to as the 'file format'. Different programs produce files in different formats - a photograph in `.jpeg` format cannot be read by a spreadsheet package, which might expect to receive files in `.xlsx` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest file format for storing and transferring scientific data is a plain text file in 'ascii' ('American Standard Code for Information Exchange') format. This is the sort of file that can be read and produced using a simple text editor such as 'notepad' (on Windows) or 'TextEdit' (on a Mac). Commonly, such files will have an extension such as `.txt` or `.dat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading ascii files in Python is a four-step process:\n",
    "1. Open the file;\n",
    "2. Read each line from the file;\n",
    "3. Parse each line (i.e., extract the required information from it);\n",
    "4. Close the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the file is already saved on your computer, and you know the 'path' to the file. To open the file, we use the `open()` function, which returns a `file` object. It is important to assign this to a variable (here, `fp`) so that we can continue to access the open file.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "filename = 'sample.dat'\n",
    "fp = open(filename,'r')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `filename` is a variable holding the file name (or file path and name, if it is not in our current working directory), and the second argument, `'r'`, specifies that we want to open the file for reading only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the file is open, we can read from it. There are various ways of doing this, but for small files the simplest method is generally to call the `readlines()` function, which returns the entire file in the form of a list:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lines = fp.readlines()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each element of the list `lines` is now a string, containing one of the lines from the file `sample.dat`. Since we have read all the information in the file, we can now close the file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fp.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "**&#10148; Try it out!**"

    "Once you have a list of strings, you can use the list- and string-parsing tools we have already encountered to extract the necessary data and store it in appropriate data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `sample.dat` contains records of the mass and volume of twenty samples of a given material.\n",
    "\n",
    "**&#10148; Read the data from this file, compute the density of each sample and hence the average density of the material.**"

    "To write data to file, we need to first open the file for writing. This can be done by using `'w'` instead of `'r'` when opening the file. Note that if a file already exists with the specified name, it will be immediately overwritten and lost. To avoid this, you can instead use `'x'` when opening the file. This will throw an error if there is an existing file, rather than overwrite it. Again, when opening the file it is important to assign the result of `open()` to a variable, so we can write to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "outputfile = 'processed_samples.dat'\n",
    "fp = open(outputfile,'w')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the file is open, we can write any text strings to it by calling the `write()` function. Remember, to insert a new line, you use the symbol `'\\n'`, otherwise everything will be on a single line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fp.write(\"Hello!\\n\")\n",
    "fp.write(\"This is some text to store in a file... \")\n",
    "line = \"The file has only two lines.\"\n",

    "**&#10148; Create a new file, based on the data you read earlier. It should contain three columns: mass, sample volume and sample density. All quantities should be in SI units.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you can use the string-formatting tools we encountered in the last exercise to control how your numbers are written out. You can open a text file by clicking its name in Jupyter's file browser. Verify that the file has been correctly written."

    "- [HDF5](https://www.h5py.org/), a format targeted at large datasets, very handy, easy to interact with Numpy, and also adequate for long term storage.\n",
    "- [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html), implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. This allows one to store not only arrays, but also Python objects.\n",

    "For now, we will read/write simple datasets, but do not forget such libraries which can be very handy when programming in Python."
